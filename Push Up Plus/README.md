# Push-Up-Plus_App
Personal Development Project to create an app to keep track of push-ups and regularly remind users to do their push-ups. I am developing this app for mobile iOS devices
so I am using Swift.
App includes 1) streak counter, 2) setting push-up goals and challenge level, 3) schedule/planner, 4) calendar/history, 5) notification reminders every other day, 6) tracking current push-up count/goal, 
7) selective or auto-increasing goals to coincide with streak and activity level, 8) option to record your push-ups, 9) option to save your recording to app calendar, device photos,
or share it to messages or social media apps, 9) the ability to reset or modify push-up count and goals, 10) a trophy menu to motivate users to earn bronze, silver, and gold for
streak, push-up growth, and total push-ups.
